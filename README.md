# Capstone_Project-ETFs
# For week 1, you will required to submit the following:

1. A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (15 marks)
2. A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (15 marks)

# Submission Week 1: ETFs World Map with returns

1. Problem description / background discussion (who would be interested in this project)

   (Passive) Investors in ETFs might want to exclude certain countries from their portfolios from time to time due to their negative return in the past and for increased portfolio return in the future.

    Such data in a choropleth map might be supportive for the (1) individual client, or the (2) sales management department of a bank as well and helps identifying regions of interest for the sales of ETFs tracking such indices.  A heat map would show consistent returns over the years as an additional investment argument.

2.	Data description (and use to solve the problem) and source (acquisition/cleaning)

    For simplicity reasons I first checked the largest issuer, iShares (BlackRock) for any data available on Equity ETFs.
With the link below you can access the file as well if you plan to build something similar with it. This data made my Bloomberg Terminal access obsolete for now but BBG might be an additional source for later, if needed (e.g. missing monthly price data).
The data is already sorted by Net asset (USD) so the choropleth map should choose the largest ETF for each country. There are different YTD returns available as well for the heat map. A comparison of the TER (total expense ratio) is also possible with the data set and important for the investors.

Above description will be summarized in a PPP or LinkedIn-post later on.

1.  A full report consisting of all of the following components (15 marks):
    - Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.
    - Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
    - Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
    - Results section where you discuss the results.
